# üß≠ Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a visual demonstration of four fundamental pathfinding algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**, and **A\***. Each algorithm explores a maze and finds a path from the starting point to the goal using different strategies.

## üîç Algorithms Explained

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  
  Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level. BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph but may be slower on large grids.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  
  Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is generally faster than BFS but does not guarantee the shortest path.

- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm:**  
  Uses a priority queue to explore the shortest known distance from the starting node. It guarantees the shortest path in weighted graphs and is more efficient than BFS in many cases.

- **A\* Search (A-Star):**  
  Combines the advantages of Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm with a heuristic to guide the search, making it faster and more intelligent. It‚Äôs one of the most efficient and widely used pathfinding algorithms.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use the Webpage

### BFS / DFS / Dijkstra‚Äôs:
1. Select the algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Choose the maze size (Small, Medium, Large).
3. Press **"Begin/Regenerate"** to watch the algorithm in action.

### A\* (A-Star):
1. Select **A\*** from the dropdown.
2. Choose the maze size.
3. Enter a **starting(x,y)** and **ending(x,y)** coordinate in the input fields (e.g., `0,0` and `9,9`).
4. Press **"Begin/Regenerate"** to see the optimal path.
